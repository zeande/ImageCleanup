# ImageCleanup

## Overview

ImageCleanup is a collection of scripts designed to help organize and clean up your photo collection. Over the years, many of us have accumulated a large number of photos stored across various cloud services. This project aims to streamline the process of managing these photos by downscaling large images and removing duplicates.

## Features

- **Downscale Images**: Reduce the size of large images to save cloud storage space.
- **Deduplicate Images**: Identify and remove duplicate photos, keeping only the best shot.
- **Set Created Date**: Update the 'Date Created/Modified' metadata of photos based on the Date Taken property (if available) or the date in the filename.
